The purpose of the project was to build a search engine over a list of movies that have a dedicate page on Wikipedia.

The repository consists of the following files:
* `hashing_lib.py`: python file that contains the implementation of the class used in the hashing task.
* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook that explains the strategies and code we adopted solving the homework.
