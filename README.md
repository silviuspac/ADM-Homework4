## Main Goal

The main goal of this homework is to write important algorithms and function from scratch. In particular the algorithms that will be treated are:
* Hash functions and a structure called Bloom Filter;
* Perform Alphabetical Sort exploiting the algorithm of Counting Sort;
* K-means clustering algorithm to find set of similar wines according to some characteristics;
* Example that shows that with wrong initialization, the cost of the solution produced by the k-means algorithm can be arbitrarily larger from the cost of the optimal solution.

The repository consists of the following files:
* `hashing_lib.py`: python file that contains the implementation of the class used in the hashing task.
* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook that explains the strategies and code we adopted solving the homework.
